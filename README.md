**About the Virtual Watershed Client**

The Virtual Watershed Client (VWC), is being developed as part of the Western Consortium for Watershed Analysis, Visualization, and Exploration (WC-WAVE). WC-WAVE is a tri-state consortium composed of researchers and students in Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico. Its overall aim is to study the localized impact of climate change on high-mountain catchments. The WC-WAVE project is comprised of three components: Watershed Science, Visualization and Data Cyberinfrastructure (CI), and Workforce Develop-
ment. Participants in these three components are collaborating to better understand interactions between precipitation, snow-pack, groundwater flow, and other watershed properties within mountain catchments.
